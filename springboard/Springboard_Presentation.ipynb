    "<b>1) Do you have any hypotheses around why the choice of payment option (upfront or subscription) should be correlated to completion rates?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "My initial hypothesis is that students who pay upfront are more inclined to finish the class. <b>This seems to be determined by the type of class.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "My reasoning:\n",
    "- If there is a month by month payment students who are unhappy with the class may drop before completion.\n",
    "- If someone were to pay the full amount they would feel more inclined to finish the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>After looking at the data:</b><br>\n",
    " Through 1 to 4 months, <b>average monthly retention was an average of 33%</b> for upfront payers and <b>67% for those who paid via subscription for both types of classes.</b> It turns out students who paid upfront actually had lower retention and completion rate for self-paced classes.\n",

    "As for completion it seems to have less of an effect. <b>Those who paid upfront had an average of 48% completion rate over 3 and 4 montsh versus 52% from those who paid by subscription.</b> Despite a lesser effect subscription payers still had beter completion rates. These numbers are more revealing when we take a look at these numbers grouped by class type."

    "Flexibility may be the key here. Although discounts are given through an upfront price, the choice to leave the class due to any circumstance gives a user freedom. This information can be used to start generalizing the user base at Springboard.\n",

    "<b>Numerical Observations:</b>\n",
    "- The longer the class runs the less students finish. 1 month retention is much higher than 2 etc. as well, 3 month completion is also higher than 4 month.\n",
    "- Students who paid upfront actually had lower retention and completion rate in aggregate.\n",

    "My take on visualizations is to be as simplisitic as possible. Find what story the data tells and get that point across as easily as possible.\n",

    "After looking at the data my new hypothesis is that users enjoy more flexibility and freedom. My assumption here is that students who paid by subscription had less pressure and obligation to the class. Only those who truly wanted to return, returned. Self-paced learning and the ability to pay on a subscription basis gives them that. For those who paid in full, they may have felt more obligation to finish their fixed-length class and get their full utility. Both self-paced classes and subscription based payment brought in more paid users and more users signing up for those types of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>My biggest take aways:</b><br>\n",
    "There are two types of users, users who like a self-paced classes will buy them on a subscription basis and those who like a fixed-length class will pay upfront. Second, more users are the self-paced and subscription type.<br>"

    "\n",
    "This user base preferred signing up for self-paced classes much more.\n",
    "By grouping by completion and course type it further shows the type of user who finishes and signs up for each type of class. Retention rates in aggregate are higher for those who paid by subscription but when I group by course type I see it is more dependant on that variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "My conclusion is that I believe structure does play a role in how users interact with the class. This falls more inline with my hypotheses above. Those who pay for the class in full tend to finish it. On the otherhand users like more flexibility. Users are more inclined to take classes that are self-paced and will finish them more so when paying by subscription. In this dataset it seems that self-paced subscription is better."

    "Based off the dataset I would like to try giving a bigger discount rate in hopes of attracting more users to pay in full. I would test these larger discount rates on a month by month basis to see if it has any effect on organic and paying users. Perhaps if paid user rates increase with a larger discount you could give only users from paid acquisition these types of discounts.\n",

    "I would focus on getting more users into fixed-length classes. I would reduce the length of fixed-length classes to see if rentention and completion rates rise. Another idea would be adding an incentive or more flexibility to fixed classes. Adding an ability to refund the user up until a certain point in the class could give them that feeling. "
